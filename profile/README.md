The [Centre for Music - Edition - Media (ZenMEM)](https://zenmem.uni-paderborn.de/en/zenmem) is an academic institution of the Faculty of Arts and Humanities at Paderborn University. 
ZenMEM is a decidedly open network of researchers and endeavours to jointly promote and establish new, digitally supported research 
opportunities in the field of cultural studies and to connect them to international developments.

We maintain close connections with the [Virtual Research Group Edirom (ViFE)](https://edirom.de) so you might want to browse 
the [Edirom Github](https://github.com/Edirom) organization as well.
